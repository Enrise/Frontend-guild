# Techradar Enrise Frontend (WIP)

## Introduction

As Frontenders within Enrise we want more challenging frontend work. To get an indication where everyone stands and where everyone wants to go we decided to create this TechRadar. The idea is that this TechRadar will become a living document.

# Data
Before we can set-up the radar itself we need to gather some data. In the this section we gather the data itself. 

* Javascript tooling
* CSS tooling
* Editors

## Javascript tooling
Just throw all the tools and frameworks you use in this section. We will group the techniques/tooling into the tech radar later.

### Daan (WIP)
#### Can do: 
* React
* Redux
* Webpack 1/2
* ES6
* ES5
* jQuery

#### Would like to do (and why):
3. ES2017
	1. To keep up with the JavaScript standard
4. Flow/Typescript
	1. Static typing will help creating more stable JavaScript 
5. React
	1. I really like the component based structure React offers
	2. 
6. Vue
	1. Seems like a promising framework
	2. The code seems very clean and readable
	3. Just like react component based
7. Ember
	1. I don't really know a lot about Ember but i hear more and more about it
8. Elm
	1. Not really for production use but more for personal interest in functional programming
