#Frontend Code Style

## ESLint
ESLint is our preferred JS-linter. In the eslint folder, you'll find the rulesets used for some environments we currently have in place. Grab them, turn them into a `.eslintrc` file and run ESLint to verify your code style and correctness.

Currently, we only have ES5 rules, the set of ES6 rules still have to be thought about.
