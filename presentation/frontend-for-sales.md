# Frontend guild

---

# Goal of this meeting
- Enrise traditionally is a backend focussed company
- We have frontenders as well and would like to create awareness for that
- Inform you about the latest technologies and our capabilities in that

----

# The state of frontend in 2017
- Gap between frontend and backend is closing. This means the "new frontend" fits really well in the Enrise methodology of developing.

----

# HTML5

- More semantic syntax
- A lot of new API's that should be part of every browsers toolbox

----

# Javascript frameworks

- Backbone
- Angular
- React
- Vue.js
- Many, many, many more...

----

# CSS

- Not a specific version, but rather new features (flexbox, css grid)
- Preprocessors (SASS, LESS)
- Browsers are becoming more and more predictable
- PostCSS
- CSS3 variables

----

# Tooling around frontend

- Task runners (grunt, gulp, npm scripts)
- Code Bundlers (webpack, rollupJS)
- Package managers (bower, npm, yarn)

----

# Some more trends...

- Webapps are becoming the defacto standard for providing a UI for your application:
  - They replace native apps (Progressive Web Apps)
  - They focus on offline experience as well (Service Workers)
- Performance is becoming more and more important
  - Frontenders focus on the number of FPS when creating animations now
  - For complex JS code "closer to the metal" (WebAssembly)

----

# We'd like to hop on that train!
## (and we believe we'll manage)
