# Frontend guild

---

# Goal of this meeting
- Enrise traditionally is a backend focussed company
- We have frontenders as well and would like to create awareness for that
- Inform you about the latest technologies and our capabilities in that

----

# The state of frontend in 2017
- In the early days: HTML / CSS / Javascript only
- Nowadays the gap between frontend and backend is closing
  - Javascript frameworks (Bootstrap.js, Angular, React)
  - HTML5 brought a whole lot of API's, making more stuff possible on frontend
  - CSS improves (both with preprocessors as browsersupport)
  - Tooling around frontend improves (task runners, code bundlers)
  - Package managers (Bower, NPM, Yarn)
- There's a whole world out there!

----

# Frontend focus shifts from...
- Slicing a Photoshop design
- Putting it in a bunch of `<div>` elements
- Styling stuff in CSS
- If you're the adventurous type: do some jQuery to animate elements!

----

# Frontend focus shifts to...

- Webapps are becoming the defacto standard for providing a UI for your application:
  - They replace native apps (Progressive Web Apps)
  - They focus on offline experience as well (Service Workers)
- Performance is becoming more and more important
  - Frontenders focus on the number of FPS when creating animations now
  - For complex JS code "closer to the metal" (WebAssembly)

----

# We'd like to hop on that train!
## (and we believe we'll manage)
